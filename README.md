# mobi_maker

Korean txt file convert to mobi format.

This is tested on Linux & kindle 10th generation.

# Before You Start
This is more or less WIP. Use at your own risk.

This package was written for a specific task, thus there are certain limitations, such as:

img tags are ignored and not embedded.

Number of chapters is only 1. 

TOC depth does not go beyond 1. Meaning for now you can only have chapters and sub-chapters. But sub-chaper can not have it's own sub-chapters.

HTML formatting is supported, but rendering is dependant on your eBook reader. (For Kindle see Supported HTML Tags in Book Content)
Cover images doesn't supported.

IMPORTANT: Images resized using image/jpeg package will not display (in Kindle) because JFIF APP0 marker segment is not generated by image/jpeg package.

In case of text file with EUC-KR(cp949), it may have some weird characters after convert.
